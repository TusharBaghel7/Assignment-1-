\subsection{How Indian Health Care System Evolved in last few year}
HealthCare in India goes back to ancient times and has been documented in our scriptures like Vedas and Charak Samhita. Ayurveda or the “science of life” is believed to be imparted to the sages and rishis by the gods themselves. Well, this is mythology but the fact that Ayurveda has survived for ages might itself be considered as some sort of proof of the kind of medical knowledge our ancestors possessed.\\

The British rule that lasted for over a century saw the establishment of dispensaries at district level, but they were mostly for the treatment of army personnel. At the time of independence, there were just over 7,000 hospitals in the country and called for much more to be done, starting with the availability of healthcare to every citizen irrespective of their caste, religion or occupation.\\

Eventually, by setting up a separate Health Survey and Planning Committee and introduction of Five Year Plans, healthcare saw some positive results when it came to eradication and control of epidemics.\\
Primary healthcare services were given attention. Primary centres were established in rural and urban areas.\\
The advent of private hospitals and big players also had a hand in developing healthcare and helped increase the life expectancy of the average Indian from 32 years in 1947 to 69.09 years in 2018.\\

Nowadays heath care system has Advanced so much that India was able to fought against bigest Pandemic Coronavirus 1st and 2nd wave and was able to provide vaccines to its citizen.

One of the biggest benefits technology has to offer in the healthcare sector is easier and faster access to information required for both healthcare professionals and patients. No longer do hospitals and doctors need to completely rely on the need to keep physical records for patients.\\

Technology and medical Equipments  provide cheaper, faster and more effective solutions for diseases – technologies could win the battle for us against cancer
and many dangerous disease.\\
By using technology, the medical field can make discoveries regarding treatments, data collection, symptom and disease research, cure research, human aiding devices (like hearing devices and speaking devices). Technology has made the medical area very accessible to people.



\subsection{Today level of India in Healthcare}
The situation is worrisome in rural areas, where almost 66 per cent of India's population resides. The doctor-to-patient ratio remains abysmally low, which is merely 0.7 doctors per 1,000 people. This is compared to the World Health Organisation (WHO) average of 2.5 doctors per 1,000 people.\\

India ranked 66 out of 195 countries with an overall Index score of 42.8 and along with a change of -0.8 from 2019. The United States of America (USA) ranked 1st on the index with a score of 75.9 followed by Australia and Finland.
