\section{What is Heath Care System}

A health system, also known as health care system or healthcare system, is the organization of people, institutions, and resources that deliver health care services to meet the health needs of target populations.\\
The goal of a healthcare system is to enhance the health of the population in the most effective manner possible in light of a society's available resources and competing needs.

\section{Present Heatlh Care}
The doctor-to-population ratio in India is 1:214 Though hospitals, dispensaries, public health centers and other medical facilities are present, they are not sufficient to cater to the growing needs of India's substantial population. Rural access to quality medical service has to be improved.\\
The inadequate manpower of doctors in public sector hospitals is also a concern for health authorities. Furthermore, the infrastructure required in the hospitals, like medicine, furniture and equipment, are not adequate to serve the population. Compounding the problem, government spending on healthcare services is not up to the World Health Organization (WHO) norms of gross domestic product in healthcare.

\section{Why do we need to improve healtcare and what is future healthcare need}
Overall improving the quality and performance in the healthcare environment can help providers with reliable, cost-effective and sustained healthcare processes and enable them to achieve their goal of improving care delivery and enhancing patient outcomes.\\

In the future of health, we expect six key areas—data sharing, interoperability, equitable access, empowered consumers, behavior change, and scientific breakthrough—to collectively transform the existing health system from treatment-based reactionary care to prevention and well-being.

\section{Future of Health Care}

What is "Health futures" - "Health futures" is defined as a set of tools that can help explore probable, plausible, possible, and preferable futures for guiding actions whereby potential health threats could be anticipated.\\

The future of health will likely be driven by digital transformation enabled by radically interoperable data and open, secure platforms. Health is likely to revolve around sustaining well-being rather than responding to illness. We expect prevention and early diagnoses will be central to the future of health.\paragraph{•}

What are the future challenges for health care?\\
Future Health Care Challenges\\
1.The tiering of health care.\\
2.Growing numbers of elderly people.\\ 
3.New technologies. \\
4.New and reemerging infectious diseases.\\
5.The threat of terrorism.\\
6.Rediscovery of lifestyle-related health issues.\\

\section{Technology a major role player in future healthcare}
\subsection{How technology is Healpful in Healthcare?}
By using technology, the medical field can make discoveries regarding treatments, data collection, symptom and disease research, cure research, human aiding devices (like hearing devices and speaking devices). Technology has made the medical area very accessible to people.\\
Three major benefit can be-\\
1.Improved Care Coordination\\
2.Improved Population Health Management\\
3.Improved Patient Education.\\

For PatientCare-\\
Technology helps contribute to patient-centered care by fostering communication between providers and patients via online portals, text messaging, and email. It also increases access to information such as online medical records, which can improve self-monitoring and patient convenience.\\
What are the benefits of digital technology for our patients?\\
According to the FDA, digital health technologies help providers reduce inefficiencies, improve access, reduce costs, increase quality and make medicine more personalized for patients.\\

The future of healthcare is shaping up in front of our very eyes with advances in digital healthcare technologies, such as artificial intelligence, VR/AR, 3D-printing, robotics or nanotechnology. We have to familiarize with the latest developments in order to be able to control technology and not the other way around.\\

\clearpage

Some future emerging technology are -\\

1.Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer or a robot controlled by a computer to do tasks that are usually done by humans because they require human intelligence and discernment.\\
Example are-Maps and Navigation,Digital Assistants Social Media,E-Payments etc.\\
2.3D printing is used for the development of new surgical cutting and drill guides, prosthetics as well as the creation of patient-specific replicas of bones, organs, and blood vessels.\\
3.Robotics-Medical robots assist with surgery, streamline hospital logistics, and enable providers to give more direct attention to patients. Robots in the medical field are transforming how surgeries are performed, streamlining supply delivery and disinfection, and freeing up time for providers to engage with patients.\\

These are some future emerging technology that help doctors and patient and enhance treatmment.

\section{CONCLUSION}
In present there are many problem which can be solved by technolgy thus technology will play a major role in upcoming future healthcare. Technology such as artificial intelligence and robotics are some technology which will be very beneficial in upcoing future healthcare.Future healthcare will be focousing on hat area where present heathcare is lagging behind and this will help to improve our heathcare system and make it effecient.
